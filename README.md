### Description
This app focuses on data validation and data storage.

### How to Run
Google Chrome is recommended.
Once the website loads, use the navigation bar to submit and view data.

### Support
If issues, try fixing the code using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags).

### Roadmap
One of the next steps would be to introduce the login component and track data submissions by user.
